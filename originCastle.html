        The second of the two, Castlevania, is similar to Super Metroid and is the game that really cemented the metroidvania genre. Released in 1997, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night featured a large non-linear map with many upgrades hidden throughout. Unlike Metroid, Castlevania also implemented an RPG system with experience points and leveling up that gave useful bonuses along side the different items you obtained (“Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (Game)”).
