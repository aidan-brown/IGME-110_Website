        <p>
            Super Metroid was released in 1994 to high appraisal. Even now some consider Super Metroid the greatest game of that time period. Like many metroidvania games that came after, Super Metroid had a large interconnected map with many items and power-ups scattered throughout. Acquiring these items would let the player advance through the story. Another innovation that helped lay the foundations for the metroidvania genre was Metroid’s ability to let the player play through a somewhat non-linear map. Other games attempted to make a open, non-linear game before, but Super Metroid was one of the first to get it right without sacrificing gameplay. Metroid was also widely known for its ability to reward players for using their own intuition to solve problems and get around certain obstacles (“Super Metroid (Game)”).
