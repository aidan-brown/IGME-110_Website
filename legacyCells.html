        In Dead Cells the game follows your character throughout a castle on your mission to kill the corrupt king. A neat thing that Dead Cells does is it combines the gameplay formulas of metroidvanias and rougelikes. The game still has the key components of metroidvanias such as exploring to get new items that make you more powerful, but these items are temporary. When you die in the game you must restart from the beginning without all of the items you have collected previously, but not everything resets. Throughout the games you can find these pickups called runes. Runes work slightly different than items in the sense that once you obtain a rune you have it permanently. These are similar to the movement power-ups that you see in other metroidvania games, they allow you to get to places you could not originally get to before. Another difference between Dead Cells and more traditional metroidvanias is the fact that Dead Cells has “levels.” I say “levels” because although the map is broken down into different sections it is more to let the player take a break and restore their health. The game is still non-linear to a degree because of the branching pathways that can lead the player to different levels, but all the pathways end up at the same place at some point. One of the last things that Dead Cells improved upon from the metroidvania formula is combat. Combat in Dead Cells is fluid and varied which makes for a unique experience every time you play. In Will Harrison’s review of Dead Cells, he talks about the combat briefly stating, “Taking a cue from fighting games, all the animations, attacks, jumps, and dodges are cancellable into other moves. This means that you can swing your sword at any point of a move, never locking you into a full commitment and leaving your character open to attack. With a bit of practice, you begin flying around the screen in a flurry of combos that never feel out of control or haphazard” (Harrison). Each weapon that you use throughout the game has a different and unique attack pattern and effect, which means if you go from using a greatsword to using a dagger your play style changes completely. The greatsword requires you to be careful and plan your moves, while with a dagger you rush into battle, deal damage and then dodge out of the fight. This combat can be quick to pick up, but to master the combat requires you to pay close attention to your surroundings and be able to use each and every weapon effectively.
