    <p>
        Hollow Knight, released in 2017, is a newer look on the more traditional metroidvania that focuses on perfecting the formula more than changing it. In Hollow Knight you play as a beatle that travels into the ruins of an old underground castle in search of adventure and fortune. This game includes a giant open-ended map that previous metroidvanias could accomplish, the game throws you into the ruins and you must find your purpose through exploration and discovery. Similar to metroidvanias before it, Hollow Knight also has powers that can unlock new areas to discover, but unlike other metroidvanias you don’t need all of the abilities to advance through the game. This is where Hollow Knight’s non-linear gameplay shows, you can attack the game in any way you want. You are not limited to one path and can get most powers in any order you want. Another great improvement on the formula is Hollow Knight’s combat system. In my experience it is probably the greatest part of the game, other than the art and charm. Combat is fluid and entirely based upon your skill level. You can chain attacks with your abilities in order to deal massive amounts of damage or dodge your enemy while also still dealing damage to your opponent. Even though you can pull off these crazy moves, the game is surprisingly intuitive. In his review of Hollow Knight, Tom Marks states, “Hits feel chunky and real, bouncing you back a little every time. Likewise, when an enemy lands a hit, you feel it” (Marks).  The game also incentivises you being aggressive rather than defensive which makes the game fast and intense. On each successful hit of an enemy your character gains soul which can either be used to heal yourself or launch powerful attacks. One of last things that Hollow Knight innovated on is the acquisition of items. Similarly to Castlevania, some items can be found throughout the map but most items, maps, etc. are obtained by buying them. Enter the souls like genre. The souls like genre put simply are games that use ideas or gameplay mechanics from the Dark Souls series. In this case Hollow Knight uses a somewhat similar mechanic to Dark Souls in that when you die, instead of losing all your money right away the game gives you a chance to get the money back by finding where you died and killing the evil spirit. This builds tension because if you were exploring a part of the map you don’t have the map for you need to remember the path you took that lead you to death all while not dying.
